//! Trap handling functionality
//!
//! For rCore, we have a single trap entry point, namely `__alltraps`. At
//! initialization in [`init()`], we set the `stvec` CSR to point to it.
//!
//! All traps go through `__alltraps`, which is defined in `trap.S`. The
//! assembly language code does just enough work restore the kernel space
//! context, ensuring that Rust code safely runs, and transfers control to
//! [`trap_handler()`].
//!
//! It then calls different functionality based on what exactly the exception
//! was. For example, timer interrupts trigger task preemption, and syscalls go
//! to [`syscall()`].
